<h3>Assignment 0 Reflection || 9/25/2016</h3>
<p>This assignment was kind of fun for me since I haven't written html since high school. It wasn't particularly challenging but I did have fun doing it.
It was good to practice the format of an html file again as well as use the img tag since I haven't done it in a while. My prior knowledge of web development
is pretty much limited to some amateur html and css experience. I visited W3Schools website to get a quick refresher on html examples. Overall I enjoyed 
writing this assignment.</p>
